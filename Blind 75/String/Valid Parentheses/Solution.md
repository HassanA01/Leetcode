## `isValid` Method Explanation

This method is designed to determine if a given string contains a valid sequence of parentheses. The valid sequence means that open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets, and open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

### Approach:

1. **Initialize an Empty List (`lst`)**:
    - This list will serve as a <b>stack</b> to keep track of open brackets.

2. **Traverse Through the String**:
    - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
    
    - **Open Brackets**: 
        If `i` is an open bracket (`(`, `[`, or `{`), push it onto the stack.

    - **Close Brackets**:
        For each type of close bracket:
        
        - `)`: If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not `(`, return `False`. Otherwise, pop the top of the stack.
        - `}`: If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not `{`, return `False`. Otherwise, pop the top of the stack.
        - `]`: If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not `[`, return `False`. Otherwise, pop the top of the stack.

3. **Check for Remaining Open Brackets**:
    - After processing the entire string, if the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched open brackets. In this case, return `False`.

### Output:

- If the stack is empty after processing the entire string, it indicates that the input string `s` contains a valid sequence of parentheses, and the method returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: The approach runs in <i>O(n)</i> time, where <i>n</i> is the length of the string `s`. This is because we traverse the string once and perform constant-time operations (push, pop, check top) for each character.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is <i>O(n)</i> in the worst case when all characters are open brackets. In the average case, however, the stack will not contain all characters from the string.
