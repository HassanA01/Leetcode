## `hasCycle` Method Explanation

The `hasCycle` method is designed to determine if a given linked list contains a cycle. It employs Floyd's cycle detection algorithm, commonly known as the "Tortoise and the Hare" approach.

### Approach:

1. **Initial Check**:
    - If the `head` is `None`, the linked list is empty and thus doesn't contain a cycle. Return `False`.

2. **Initialize Pointers**:
    - `slow_ptr` (Tortoise): Starts at the `head` and advances one node at a time.
    - `fast_ptr` (Hare): Starts at the next node (`head.next`) and advances two nodes at a time.

3. **Cycle Detection**:
    - While traversing the linked list:
    
        - If `fast_ptr` or its next node is `None`, it means we've reached the end of the list without encountering a cycle. Return `False`.
        
        - Advance `slow_ptr` by one node and `fast_ptr` by two nodes.
        
        - If `slow_ptr` and `fast_ptr` meet (i.e., they point to the same node), it indicates the presence of a cycle in the linked list. Return `True`.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: <i>O(n)</i> in the worst case, where <i>n</i> is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because in the presence of a cycle, the fast pointer will meet the slow pointer within a maximum of 2 loops.
  
- **Space Complexity**: <i>O(1)</i>, as we only use two pointers regardless of the size of the linked list.
